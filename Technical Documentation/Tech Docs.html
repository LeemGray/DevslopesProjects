                Racing is a sport that has recently boomed massively in
                popularity as a result of Drive to Survive on Netflix.

                To put it simply, racing is a bunch of cars, going from formula
                cars to hot hatchbacks, going around a predetermined track for a
                specific amount of time or laps, and who ever finishes with the
                fastest time, or before the other cars...wins!

                There are many different kinds of racing, with the most popular
                types falling under these categories
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Formula Racing</strong> - Heavily regulated open
                  wheeled cars that are typically built around aerodynamics
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rally Racing</strong> - Bravery
                  personified...typically hot hatchbacks with a driver and
                  co-driving telling him where the turns are
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stock-Car Racing</strong> - Big loud cars going in
                  circles! Basically a chessmatch at 200mph
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Endurance Racing</strong> - A real test of drivers and
                  engineering. Races can last from 6 to 24 hours with driver
                  changing and different classes of cars sharing a track
                </li>
              </ul>

                Because we like to go fast and we like to win! There's something
                therapeutic about striving to complete the perfect lap.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the engineering perspective, building a car that is faster,
                stronger, and more reliable than other manufacturers is a
                special pride point
              </p>
              <p>From a business perspective...marketing</p>

                This is the most important part of unlocking speed. Horsepower
                and grip are good but you can't get good times if you can't
                maximize the track
              </p>
              <p>
                A common misconception in racing is that the line in a corner is
                the shortest distance from A to B but that's not completely
                true! The real fastest line is what allows to to carry the most
                amount of speed for the exit
              </p>
              <p>The rule of thumb is "slow in-fast out"</p>

            <article>
              <p>Managing tires is a very close second to unlocking lap time</p>
              <p>
                They are not omnipotent so tip-toeing on the limit of your tires
                at all times is key.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accelerating, braking, and turning are your tires' main jobs.
                They cannot give you full grip doing one thing if they're doing
                another, treat it like a budget
              </p>
